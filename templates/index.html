                <ul>
                    <li><b>Q: How does ArkhRec work?</b></li>
                    <p>ArkhRec analyses card cooccurrences on decklists publicly posted on ArkhamDB. The current version evaluates all decklists posted between Jan 1st 2021 and Aug 3rd 2022 (~2k unique decks). If this website proves useful to the community, it could be updated to: (1) start fetching new decklists automatically every day and (2) consider decklists published before 2022 (correcting by new products' release date biases)</p>
                    <li><b>Q: Does this tool recomend the *best* cards for each deck?</b></li>
                    <p><b>NO!</b> Just cards that appear frequently together in public ArkhamDB decklists. This does not mean these are the "best" cards for the deck. </p>
                    <li><b>Q: If this does not recommend the *best* cards, isn't this useless?</b></li>
                    <p><b>NO!</b> Well, maybe, but there are at least three main use cases for this tool:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <b><li>Get inspiration</li></b>
                        <p>Sometimes you are just wondering "are there any Bob Jenkins decks that do not use Scavenging? Could I build one?".</p>
                        <b><li>Get "deck fillers"</li></b>
                        <p>You've selected 25 awesome cards for your next Forgotten Age run - what are the other 5 cards you could include in the deck? Also, do you have a good asset/event/skill distribution (this site makes the calculation automatically for you, thank me later)</p>
                        <b><li>Get a quick ready-to-go serviceable deck for beginners</li></b>
                        <p>ArkhamDB is awesome, but it can be daunting for new players. The sheer amount of decks per investigator makes it diffcult for a begginner to choose one. Here, they will get an "average" deck for every investigator they'd like to play with. Granted, it won't have any explanations about how to use them and it would be, well, "average".</p>
                    </ol>
